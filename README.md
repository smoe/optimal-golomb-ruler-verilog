optimal-golomb-ruler-verilog
============================

This project aims at using a single source tree for the generation of readily synthesisable FPGA code for a range of FPGA boards, simulators and assembly rewriters. The Optimal Golomb Rulers as a challenge were motivated by the http://distributed.net project. This project is successful once a diversity of implementations for various FPGA boards is available to jointly accelerate the computation.
